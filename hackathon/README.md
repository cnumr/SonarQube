  üéà Challenge üéà
</h1>

Help us improve ecoCode (powered by SonarQube) by contributing to various work packages (WPs).

<h2>Prerequisites ‚öíÔ∏è</h2>

https://docs.sonarqube.org/latest/extend/developing-plugin/

<h2>WP#1 - Cross-Platform Rules üíª</h2>

<h2>WP#2 - Android-Specific Rules üì±</h2>

If you are a mobile developer, you can contribute to our [Android plugin](../sonarqube-plugin-greenit/android-plugin/). Android-specific rules relies on a multi-scope scanning, including Java source files, Xml files and Gradle files.

Before submitting an Android-specific SonarQube custom rule , please take a look at our [naming conventions](https://doc.rules.ecocode.io/#how-to-specify-rules). Idealy, take also a look at the [helpers fonctions](https://github.com/cnumr/ecoCode/tree/main/sonarqube-plugin-greenit/android-plugin/src/main/java/io/ecocode/java/checks/helpers) we wrote to avoid doing things the hard way.

<h3>Environment</h3>

The set or rules comes from the detailed [Energy Smells catalog](https://olegoaer.perso.univ-pau.fr/android-energy-smells/). 3/4 have already been implemented in the plugin. Table of unimplemented rules below:

| # | **Rule Name**      |     **Scope**     |
|---|:----------------|:-------------:|
| ELEA001 | Everlasting Service        | Java |
| EBOT004 | Uncached Data Reception       | Java |
| ESOB003 | Dark UI      | Java, Xml |
| ESOB009 | Day Night Mode     | File System, Xml |
| ESOB014 | High Frame Rate | Java |
| EBAT001 | Service@Boot-time    | Java, Xml  |
| EREL003 | Supported Version Range    |  Xml, Gradle |
| EREL004 | Same dependencies    | Gradle |
| EREL005 | Duplicate dependencies    | Gradle |
| EREL006 | Fat app    | Gradle |
| EREL007 | Clear cache    | Java |
| EREL008 | WebP image | File System |
| EREL009 | Shrink Resources    | Gradle |
| EREL010 | Disable Obfuscation    | Gradle |


<h3>Social</h3>

The set or rules comes from the detailed [Social Smells catalog](https://olegoaer.perso.univ-pau.fr/android-social-smells/index.html) (work in progress). 0 rules have been implemented so far in the plugin. Table of unimplemented rules below:

| # | **Rule Name**      |     **Scope**     |
| ---|:----------------|:-------------:|
| SPRI001 | Crashlytics automatic opt-in       | Java, Xml |
| SPRI002 | Hidden Tracker Risk      | Gradle |
| SPRI003 | Tracking Id      | Java |
| SPRI004 | Explain Permission     | Java |
| SGDP001 | Google consent | Java |
| SINC001 | Aging devices   | Gradle  |

<h3>Contest</h3>

Some practices are extremely hard to detect statically, yet well-proven to have an impact on the device's battery. To illustrate, let's try with the 3 rules below:
- Infinite Scroll: detect if the display contains an infinite scrolling strategy (with lazy loading)
- Caching network calls: detect if the result of a network call are stored in a data structure, for its later reuse
- Memoization: refer to the results of this [research paper](https://greenlab.di.uminho.pt/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/CIbSE19_memoization.pdf)

<h2>WP#3 - New Practices / Rules Assessment üí¨</h2>

If you are not interested by implementing SonarQube rules, you may contribute to the identification of new good practices, even in an informal way. Take inspiration from [Best practices for energy efficient software](https://wiki.cs.vu.nl/green_software/Best_practices_for_energy_efficient_software) and try to target a platform or a language.

Also, you can try to evaluate the impact of implemented rules on real projects to help us to set their severity (minor, major, critical, blocker) and their estimated remediation costs.
